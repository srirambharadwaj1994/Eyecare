# Eyecare
Eyecare interface created using C#.Net and  Microsoft SQL server

The idea of Online Eye Care System project is to develop which focuses on some modules of management of the Eye care clinic. It allows users to maintain the records of the patients and also it allows doing the manual operations in an automated form. It provides details on treatment, facilities, eye care products and customers record.

Each patient registered at the hospital will be assigned a unique file which will consist of data from all their visits to the hospital. 
The doctor who conducts the assessment will save all eye power related information and prescriptions on the system. 
This will make the whole process transparent for the user, as they will be able to view the history of their eye problems in one location.

This Online Eye Care System can be used by Eye doctors or Optometrists to manage their practice. 
Out of all the specialties in medical science this is one of the most frequently visited due to the requirement of repeated check â€“ ups. 
This system can be used to save patient records, schedule appointments and place orders for custom eye equipment.
